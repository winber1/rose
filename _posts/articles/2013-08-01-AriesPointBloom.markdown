When we see a rosebud, we
know that contained within it is the
promise of an emergent flower.
Encased in the bud, this future blossom
is not fully formed; it is still
needing development and growth,
awaiting the moment when it will
burst into the light.

As the bud slowly swells with the
developing flower, we anticipate the
bloom and the expression of beauty
that has been concealed from sight.
When the bud reaches maturity, it
opens; the hidden flower expands into
full view, its petals stretching to the
outside air.

We know that nature provides
the perfect timing for the bud to
blossom. With the right conditions
of nourishment, temperature, and
sunlight, the flowering plant can’t help
but respond. We observe, in this characteristic
ritual, the outward expression
of what was contained within the
bud, and we’re invited to appreciate
the public stage of development in the
natural growth cycle.

As nature exhibits in the rosebud’s
unfolding, so does astrology provide
the perfect timing for our personal
inner potential to bloom. But instead
of temperature and sunlight combining
to create the right conditions, we
find the planets moving by solar arc to
a special “bloom zone” in the zodiac.

The symbol of the rosebud’s
opening — the blossoming and public
expression of the flower — can
suggest what happens when a planet
or angle in the horoscope moves to
the Aries Point (AP) by solar arc. The
opening, the blooming, the development
and revelation of the potential within, are all words and phrases that
convey what happens during an AP
solar arc.



**The Aries Point**

There is an extremely sensitive and
powerful zone in the zodiac located at
the 0° point of the four cardinal signs —
a special area that relates to high public
visibility. Actually, we could say that the
Aries Point has an orb that starts at 29°
mutable and ends at 1° cardinal. Planets
or angles at the Aries Point in our natal
chart have the potential for high visibility
in life. Sometimes this can suggest
fame or notoriety. The AP indicates
the presence of energy insistence that
pushes a planet or angle into public
view.

For example, if the Ascendant in
the natal chart is at the Aries Point,
there is extra potential for one’s outer
personality to be projected into the public
arena. It may be easier for the AP
Ascendant person to be visible and to
get noticed. This can naturally assist the
individual in moving to high levels of
public recognition. Because of this, the
person is often perceived as having a
“big” personality. Astrologer Noel Tyl
has an AP Ascendant at exactly 0°
Cancer. Tyl has a large and powerfully
emotive personality that is easily projected
publicly. When he walks into a
room, everyone feels it.

When we see Mercury at the AP in
the natal chart, we know that communication
skills (including writing ability)
may well be recognized. There is also
high public visibility suggested in areas
related to the natal houses that Mercury
rules or the house it occupies. Author
J.R.R. Tolkien had natal Mercury at the
AP in Capricorn in the super-creative
5th house in his generally accepted
chart. Tolkien also had natal Saturn at
0° Libra. And isn’t it interesting that his
Lord of the Rings trilogy was built upon
the story’s detailed historical context
and deeply defined character lineage?
We see his AP Saturn and Mercury shining
though the rich language he created
in his powerful fantasy series.

>>The Aries Point offers
the clear potential of
enhanced visibility,
both natally and during
the periods when
planets and angles
move to the 0° cardinal
zone by solar arc.

Many athletes have planets at  the
AP in their natal chart, including hockey
superstar Wayne Gretzky (Mars), along
with NFL quarterbacks Brett Favre
(Mercury), Tom Brady (Venus), and
Terry Bradshaw (Uranus). Bradshaw’s
AP Uranus makes sense, highlighting
the spontaneity, the urge for adventure,
and the quick thinking needed to be a
great pro quarterback. Tom Brady’s AP
Venus has certainly helped him with
his public appeal; he’s been named as
one of the sexiest male athletes on more
than one occasion. Brett Favre, whose
AP Mercury at 0° Libra is conjunct Uranus
(5° Libra), is noted for being a
smart, intuitive signal caller.

You would naturally think that a
famous athlete might have an AP Mars.
But the Mars influence is not limited
to highly visible athletic performance.
I have a client who is a decorated Navy
SEAL, and he has the natal Moon at 0°
Aries. Here, we see the Mars energy
working through the extremely competitive
AP Moon in Aries.

Motivational speaker Tony Robbins
has Jupiter at 29°57' Sagittarius, just a
few minutes from being exactly at 0°
Capricorn. The AP Jupiter in late Sagittarius
makes so much sense for the type
of work Robbins does. You can’t help
but see and feel his bold enthusiasm
and positivity when he lectures.

The Aries Point offers the clear
potential of enhanced visibility. This naturally
applies to our natal chart through
our lifetime — *and it is also true during
the periods when planets and angles
move to the 0° cardinal zone by solar arc.*
