      <h2>The Aries Point Bloom</h2>

      <p><a href="../../../../../img/articles/AriesPointBloom.pdf">View pdf version of the file</a><br />

<p><b>published in the Mountain Astrologer Magazine</b></p>

<p><img style="float:left; width:25%; margin:0px 15px 10px 0px; box-sizing:content-box;" src="../../../../../img/articles/AP_bloom.jpg" />When we see a rosebud, we
know that contained within it is the
promise of an emergent flower.
Encased in the bud, this future blossom
is not fully formed; it is still
needing development and growth,
awaiting the moment when it will
burst into the light.</p>

<p>As the bud slowly swells with the
developing flower, we anticipate the
bloom and the expression of beauty
that has been concealed from sight.
When the bud reaches maturity, it
opens; the hidden flower expands into
full view, its petals stretching to the
outside air.</p>

<p>We know that nature provides
the perfect timing for the bud to
blossom. With the right conditions
of nourishment, temperature, and
sunlight, the flowering plant can’t help
but respond. We observe, in this characteristic
ritual, the outward expression
of what was contained within the
bud, and we’re invited to appreciate
the public stage of development in the
natural growth cycle.</p>

<p>As nature exhibits in the rosebud’s
unfolding, so does astrology provide
the perfect timing for our personal
inner potential to bloom. But instead
of temperature and sunlight combining
to create the right conditions, we
find the planets moving by solar arc to
a special “bloom zone” in the zodiac.</p>

<p>The symbol of the rosebud’s
opening — the blossoming and public
expression of the flower — can
suggest what happens when a planet
or angle in the horoscope moves to
the Aries Point (AP) by solar arc. The
opening, the blooming, the development
and revelation of the potential within, are all words and phrases that
convey what happens during an AP
solar arc.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><b>The Aries Point</b></p>

<p>There is an extremely sensitive and
powerful zone in the zodiac located at
the 0° point of the four cardinal signs —
a special area that relates to high public
visibility. Actually, we could say that the
Aries Point has an orb that starts at 29°
mutable and ends at 1° cardinal. Planets
or angles at the Aries Point in our natal
chart have the potential for high visibility
in life. Sometimes this can suggest
fame or notoriety. The AP indicates
the presence of energy insistence that
pushes a planet or angle into public
view.</p>

<p>For example, if the Ascendant in
the natal chart is at the Aries Point,
there is extra potential for one’s outer
personality to be projected into the public
arena. It may be easier for the AP
Ascendant person to be visible and to
get noticed. This can naturally assist the
individual in moving to high levels of
public recognition. Because of this, the
person is often perceived as having a
“big” personality. Astrologer Noel Tyl
has an AP Ascendant at exactly 0°
Cancer. Tyl has a large and powerfully
emotive personality that is easily projected
publicly. When he walks into a
room, everyone feels it.</p>

<p>When we see Mercury at the AP in
the natal chart, we know that communication
skills (including writing ability)
may well be recognized. There is also
high public visibility suggested in areas
related to the natal houses that Mercury
rules or the house it occupies. Author
J.R.R. Tolkien had natal Mercury at the
AP in Capricorn in the super-creative
5th house in his generally accepted
chart. Tolkien also had natal Saturn at
0° Libra. And isn’t it interesting that his
Lord of the Rings trilogy was built upon
the story’s detailed historical context
and deeply defined character lineage?
We see his AP Saturn and Mercury shining
though the rich language he created
in his powerful fantasy series.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Aries Point offers
the clear potential of
enhanced visibility,
both natally and during
the periods when
planets and angles
move to the 0° cardinal
zone by solar arc.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Many athletes have planets at  the
AP in their natal chart, including hockey
superstar Wayne Gretzky (Mars), along
with NFL quarterbacks Brett Favre
(Mercury), Tom Brady (Venus), and
Terry Bradshaw (Uranus). Bradshaw’s
AP Uranus makes sense, highlighting
the spontaneity, the urge for adventure,
and the quick thinking needed to be a
great pro quarterback. Tom Brady’s AP
Venus has certainly helped him with
his public appeal; he’s been named as
one of the sexiest male athletes on more
than one occasion. Brett Favre, whose
AP Mercury at 0° Libra is conjunct Uranus
(5° Libra), is noted for being a
smart, intuitive signal caller.</p>

<p>You would naturally think that a
famous athlete might have an AP Mars.
But the Mars influence is not limited
to highly visible athletic performance.
I have a client who is a decorated Navy
SEAL, and he has the natal Moon at 0°
Aries. Here, we see the Mars energy
working through the extremely competitive
AP Moon in Aries.</p>

<p>Motivational speaker Tony Robbins
has Jupiter at 29°57’ Sagittarius, just a
few minutes from being exactly at 0°
Capricorn. The AP Jupiter in late Sagittarius
makes so much sense for the type
of work Robbins does. You can’t help
but see and feel his bold enthusiasm
and positivity when he lectures.</p>

<p>The Aries Point offers the clear
potential of enhanced visibility. This naturally
applies to our natal chart through
our lifetime — <em>and it is also true during
the periods when planets and angles
move to the 0° cardinal zone by solar arc.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Solar Arcs</b></p>

<p>When we use solar arcs in analysis,
we know that, generally, planets and
angles are moved forward 1 degree per
year of life. I say “generally” because 1
degree = 1 year will work for everyone
until they are 30 years old. After age 30,
we need to consider the month of birth
and make appropriate corrections to the
timing.</p>

<p>For anyone who is born in March
through September, the 1 year = 1
degree of solar arc timing will start to
break down after 30 years, because the
arc moves a bit slower. Solar arcs are
based on the speed of the Sun, and the
daily motion of the Sun is slower from
March through September.1
 With these
horoscopes, we need to add one more
year to make the calculation work. In
other words, for a planet to move 30
degrees of solar arc, it will take 31 years.
However, for someone born in October
through February, arcing the natal
planets forward 30 degrees will equal 30
years of life.</p>

<p>This is important to understand
because, for prediction purposes, we
like to see when the solar arc measurement
is exact. Each month, there is 5
minutes of movement (5 minutes x 12
months = 60 minutes, or 1 degree).
This may sound very technical, but
when you use just your eyes (instead
of the computer) to move the planets
forward by solar arc, you will need to
know this. By 62 years of life, March–
September births will have accumulated
only 60 degrees of movement
forward by solar arc, or 62 years of life
= 60 degrees of arc (it takes an extra 2
years — 1 year per every 30). Whereas
the October–February births remain an
even arc of 60 years of life = 60 degrees
of arc.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Looking for the AP Arc</b></p>

<p>When a point in our horoscope hits
the AP by solar arc, the energy of the
planet or angle moving to that point
blooms and is projected into public view.
If we use the flower analogy — and link
it to astrological timing with solar arcs
— we could say that the “bud” begins
to develop at 28° of the mutable signs,
it swells with growth at 29° mutable,
opens completely and peaks in beauty
or impact at 0° cardinal, and maintains the bloom through the 1° degree cardinal
point.</p>

<p>To calculate the age at which a
planet solar arced to the AP, simply
count how many degrees it would take
from its natal position to reach 0° cardinal
(the AP includes all four cardinal
signs). If it is less than 30 degrees,
there’s no need to make a correction. If
it is more than 30 degrees, add an extra
year if the birthday is in March through
September.</p>

<p>Here’s an example, using just my
eyes. My natal Sun is at 29° Scorpio. I
know that if I add 30 degrees of arc to
29° Scorpio, my Sun would be at 29°
Sagittarius. So, at 30 years of age, my
Sun had reached the beginning place
of the AP (29° mutable). If I add one
more degree, the Sun was at 0° Capricorn,
exactly on the AP when I was 31
years old.</p>

<p>The same holds true for any one
of the angles in your chart. Example: A
Midheaven of 2° Virgo would move by
solar arc to the AP at age 28, because if
you add 28 degrees to 2° Virgo, you get
0° Libra.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><b>The Bloom</b></p>

<p>I was introduced to the power of
solar arcs to the Aries Point through my
studies with Noel Tyl. He pioneered
the powerful idea that when a planet
solar arcs to the AP, the potential of
that planet comes forward and is projected
into public view. When I heard
this, I instantly went to my own chart
to check it out. Using just my eyes, I
moved each planet to the AP and noted
my age. I was astounded! Every single
time a planet hit the AP by solar arc, I
had something significant happen in my
life — something very prominent, very
“public.”</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Mercury = AP</b> at age 9-1/2 years: I
tested well in school and was placed
in the gifted class for 4th grade. I had
an intellectual bloom.</li>
<li> <b>Pluto = AP</b> at age 24: I felt empowered
and started my private practice in
astrology, as well as traveled nationally
to teach intuitive development.
I enjoyed a lot of publicity through radio and newspaper interviews at that
time, too.</li><p><br /></p>


<blockquote><blockquote>When looking at
Aries Point arcs,
we obviously
must also look
at the whole
picture in the
horoscope.</blockquote></blockquote>

<li> <b>Sun = AP</b> at age 31: I got married in
a wonderful ceremony and celebration.
This makes sense because my
natal Sun is in the 7th house of relationships.</li>
<li> <b>Ascendant = AP</b> (in Cancer): I gave
birth to my first child; the nurturing
part of my personality blossomed.</li>
<li> <b>Mars = AP</b> at age 38: I relocated
from Denver, Colorado to Virginia
Beach. Leaving my birthplace and
the center of my business took a lot
of personal courage!</li>
<li> <b>Uranus and Jupiter = AP</b> at ages
43 and 44: I was deeply involved in
martial arts, which included a great
deal of sparring. I received my black
belt right when Jupiter moved by
solar arc to 0° Capricorn — a very
meaningful personal achievement
for me.</li>
<li> <b>Midheaven and Neptune = AP</b> (in
2012): I have experienced increased
visibility because of my YouTube videos
(interesting that Neptune rules
video!), and my art business is getting
more recognition.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I said … astounding!</p>

<p>When looking at AP arcs, we obviously
must also look at the whole picture
in the horoscope. We should always
check for strong transits or other solar
arcs that can assist us in our analysis.
There are numerous transits and solar
arcs that will help with success — and in
many cases, high achievement and visibility
will occur without an AP arc.</p>

<p>We have lots of measurements in
our astrological toolbox — adding the
AP arc is very helpful. Whether this cycle
produces a period of high publicity,
or simply a strong emotional bloom and
an embrace of special empowerment,
there is undeniable development and
personal growth when a planet moves
to the Aries Point by solar arc.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Using the AP Arc with Clients</b></p>

<p>When I work with clients, I consistently
check to see when planets will
move to the AP by solar arc. I know
that if I can open a client’s mind to the
potential of an Aries Point “bloom”
— and the ensuing potential for exposure
offered by this cycle — that person
is then able to create practical strategies
that enhance the incredible growth
opportunity. If we know that a planet
will hit the 0° cardinal point — say, in
three or four years — we are able to set
up better conditions for success, because
we are prepared to cooperate with the
astrology.</p>

<p>I often specifically mention to clients
that the “pre-bloom” time frame (planets
or angles at 28° and 29° mutable
by solar arc) signals the “bud phase”
of a growth cycle. There is enormous
background activity and inner development
going on in the last few degrees of
the mutable signs, much of it happening
behind the scenes and hidden from
view. During the bud phase, there exists
an inner process whereby we gradually
gather the resources necessary to build
the inner strength that we need in order
to feel comfortable blossoming and risking
our vulnerabilities by going public.</p>

<p>The power and energy of the planet
or angle blooms and becomes more visible
when the AP “emergence point” at
0° cardinal is reached. This is an explosion
of potential that has been held
within — a time when our talents or
drive can more easily come into public
view. It’s like stepping out from the
shadows and into a spotlight.</p>

<p>We can use this bloom cycle strategically
by calculating when the AP will
be activated in the horoscope by solar
arc. Just as we know that the flower will
bloom in springtime due to the molecular
changes triggered during warmer
weather and longer days, we can start
to feel secure in our anticipation that the solar arc to the Aries Point activates a
time of emergence in our life.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Blooming in Accord
with Our Life Path</b></p>

<p>For people whose life plan corresponds
with high public visibility, this
emergence cycle is welcomed and easily
embraced — it resonates. Those who
enjoy the spotlight will more naturally
cooperate with the publicity because
this is their arena, and they willingly
jump in with a hearty smile. With clients
who are extroverted and are comfortable
in high visibility public positions,
I know I can suggest that they should
utilize the AP solar arc strategically to
launch something new, or actively start
a strong marketing campaign or push
for publicity. The typical, driven, “Type
A” personality will certainly have more
potential for grand exposure during an
Aries Point arc, because these individuals
will more readily engage the energy
that this cycle offers. For some, the AP
bloom can help them to step into a new
level of public success, sometimes even
fame. An outward (measurable) level of
achievement frequently results. Here are
some examples of “big blooms” in the
lives of the famous.</p>

<p>The horoscope for the late superstar
singer Whitney Houston offers a great
illustration of a spectacular Aries Point
bloom. Houston had a cluster of points
that moved by solar arc to the AP in a
three-year period.</p>

<ul>
<li> 1983: <b>Pluto = 0° Libra.</b> This is
when Houston got her big break. She
was offered a fantastic recording
contract. After she signed, she
made her television debut on
The Merv Griffin Show.</li>
<li> 1984: <b>Mercury = 0° Libra.</b>
She released her first single,
which became a Top 5
rhythm and blues hit. </li>
<li> 1985: <b>Mercury = 1°
Libra.</b> On February 14,
1985, she released her first
album, Whitney Houston.</li>
<li>1986: <b>Ascendant = 0° Aries.</b>
Houston received four Grammy
nominations, including Album of the Year, and won the award for Best
Pop Vocal Performance. In 1987
(with solar arc Ascendant at 1° Aries),
her album earned a Grammy nomination
for Record of the Year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Writer J. K. Rowling has a classic
“rags to riches” story, triggered by an
AP arc. The author’s first book in the
Harry Potter fantasy series was published
in 1997, when Rowling had solar
arc Mercury exactly at 0° Libra. At the
same time, transiting Uranus was opposite
her Sun, and just a few months earlier,
so was transiting Jupiter. What a
fantastic recipe — a “magic potion”
— for sudden success, reward, and visibility
in publishing! Here, we see an
amazing and beautiful synchronicity
with astrological symbolism.</p>

<p>Imagine being her astrologer, doing
a consultation with her several years
prior to her big break, and spotting Mercury
moving toward the Aries Point.</p>

<p>This would have presented a logical
opportunity to suggest that there could
be a decided bloom period in her writing
in 1997. Surely this would be the
time for her astrologer to encourage
her to continue writing, to stay on track
with her aspirations. She had been writing
fantasy stories since she was a child,
and success in pursuing this passion was
one of her dreams. Interestingly, she
came up with the idea for the story of
a young boy attending a school of wizardry
in 1990, when her natal Venus
had solar arced to 0° Libra!</p>

<p>Rowling’s spectacular fame and
high public visibility is a classic example
of a bloom that had been in development
for many years, with much hard
work and perseverance leading to success.
She is now a billionaire and is the
United Kingdom’s best-selling author
since records have been kept.</p>

<p><b>Vatican City and the
Papal Transition</b></p>

<p>Another interesting example of the
solar arc Aries Point energy — and one
with incredibly interwoven threads of
AP influence — is drawn from important
current events. On February 11, 2013
came a shocking announcement, catching
many Catholics off guard, that
Pope Benedict XVI was resigning,
abruptly, because of health concerns.
He became the first Pontiff in 600 years
to quit the office. When we look at his
horoscope, we see Uranus oriental at
the Aries Point! (<b>See Chart 1</b>)
Benedict has the natal signature of
strong individualism and being in the
spotlight due to sudden unexpected
change.</p>

<p>What’s fascinating about
this situation is that, if we consider
the horoscope for Vatican
City (not shown), we find that,
on the very day the announcement
shocked the world, solar
arc (SA) Uranus was at 0°50’
Cancer — sitting right at the
Aries Point. The startling disruption
in Catholic tradition
needed to come forward into the
public eye at this time. Also, we
must notice that the Vatican City
SA Uranus was squaring Pope Benedict’s
natal Uranus in Aries, exactly to
the minute! The suggestion here is that the Vatican City SA Uranus acted as a
trigger to spark Benedict’s natal Uranus,
and we had a public surprise that produced
a powerful shock wave for Catholic
tradition around the world.</p>

<p>This story wouldn’t be complete
without mentioning that, just hours after
the announcement of Benedict’s resignation,
lightning (a common Uranus
symbol) struck St. Peter’s dome at the
Vatican.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><blockquote>When Pope Benedict
announced his resignation, the
Vatican City solar arc Uranus
at 0° Cancer was squaring his
natal Uranus in Aries,
exactly to the minute!</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>The signal from SA Uranus at the
Aries Point in the Vatican City horoscope
reflects that the time is ripe for a
pope — and a papal transition — that
may not conform to long-held rules of
tradition, or will bring fresh, new ideas
and patterns to the Church. Immediately
we saw this manifest with the election of
Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina as
the new Pontiff on March 13, 2013. He
is the first pope from the Americas and
the first from the Southern Hemisphere.first to choose the name Francis, in
honor of St. Francis of Assisi.
Pope Francis has pioneered a new
way of doing things — some might even
say a “revolutionary” way. He prefers
to live in simple quarters in the Vatican
instead of moving into the regal papal
apartments; he refused to sit in a chair
on a pedestal while he received the cardinals’
pledges of obedience after his
election (he chose instead to stand at
their same level); and he washed the
feet of two girls during a Holy Thursday
ritual. If you do a Web search of “Pope
Francis breaking tradition,” you will find
many such examples.</p>

<p>He is also the first Jesuit pope and the first to choose the name Francis, in
honor of St. Francis of Assisi.
Pope Francis has pioneered a new

to live in simple quarters in the Vatican
instead of moving into the regal papal
apartments; he refused to sit in a chair
on a pedestal while he received the cardinals’
pledges of obedience after his
election (he chose instead to stand at
their same level); and he washed the
feet of two girls during a Holy Thursday
ritual. If you do a Web search of “Pope
Francis breaking tradition,” you will find
many such examples.</p>

<p>When we look at the horoscope for
Pope Francis, we see that SA Mercury
was at 29° Pisces at the time he was
elected! (<b>See Chart 2</b>) Mercury
rules his 3rd and 12th houses — and
isn’t it interesting that his papal message
revolves around humility and compassion
for the poor? The full bloom (Mercury
reaching 0° Aries by solar arc) will
happen in January 2014, so watch for
an even more profound papal repositioning.
This new pope has something
important to communicate, a message
that will continue to draw public attention
as his SA Mercury blooms.
This is the magnificent bloom of SA
Uranus at the AP in Vatican City’s horoscope
— interwoven with both the outgoing
and incoming popes’ charts — in
full view for all the world to see and for
astrologers to appreciate.</p>

<p><b>Less Visible Blooms</b></p>

<p>So often in our culture, we focus
our assessment and approval primarily
on fame or measurable success (accumulation
of wealth, awards, popularity,
etc.). High outward achievement
can be a wonderful thing, something
to be proud of. But how does the AP
bloom manifest for an individual whose
life purpose involves being humble,
quiet, and behind the scenes? What
can we anticipate, for instance, if one
is in the middle of motherhood, giving
total attention and energy to being
of service to the family? Or how do we view an executive assistant who does all
the important administrative work “off
stage” so that a CEO can shine? How
does this cycle manifest for the more
easygoing, introverted, or serviceoriented
personalities?</p>

<p>This is critical to consider when
working with clients, especially in how
you present the potential offered during
a powerful solar arc cycle. For greatest
accuracy and benefit in consultations,
we need to adjust our expectations of
how the planet moving to the AP will
manifest, according to the life path, circumstances,
and practical reality of the
client.</p>

<p>Sometimes the bloom that is experienced
during the solar arc to the AP
isn’t particularly happy or harmonious.
In other words, the process of “opening”
can be difficult, dramatic, occasionally
even painful. If our life path is out
of balance or off track, and we need to
make adjustments in our direction in
order to have more personal fulfillment,
this little gem of a measurement can
provide the push in the right direction.
Following are a few examples.</p>

<p>One of my clients, “Ann” (all client
names are pseudonyms), had been very
unhappy in her marriage for four years,
and we had many consultations where
this issue was discussed. She wanted
to leave her husband and start a new
life, but her long-held pattern of guilt
restrained her. There were many transits
and solar arcs that suggested the divorce
(the fresh start) during the four years
when she was intensely wrestling with
her feelings — some of these transits
and solar arcs were, in fact, very forceful.
With every occurrence, I wondered
whether these cycles would provide the
signal for her to break free. Even though
her frustration increased and her dissatisfaction
grew with each tense aspect,
Ann still couldn’t bring herself to take
action.</p>

<p>Ultimately, when her Sun (ruling
the 4th house) moved by solar arc to
29°30’ Virgo, Ann came in for a consultation
and announced that she was
finally ready to make a decisive move.
Everything was suddenly crystal clear.
Her plan was to get her finances and
records in order so that she could leave
her husband and start a new life within
six months. She had instinctively connected with the rhythm of her Sun moving
toward the 0° Libra point by solar
arc! The inner confidence that she
needed to start a new life was in the
process of coming forward — in public
view — to an irresistible action point.
All the powerful transits in her chart for
the previous four years had prompted
and accelerated the process, but it took
the arrival of the AP bloom cycle for her
to act.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<blockquote><blockquote>We need to adjust
our expectations
of how the planet
moving to the AP
will manifest,
according to

circumstances,
and practical reality
of the client.</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Another client (“Nancy”) had a
cluster of AP solar arcs between the
ages of 31 and 35. During that time, she
was in a pattern of self-sabotage and
underachievement due to alcohol addiction
and substance abuse. When I was
doing research for this article, I asked
Nancy how she experienced the first AP
arc at age 31 (Jupiter = 0° Capricorn
and Mars = 0° Cancer). She instantly
said that it was a period of much inner
growth and that she had felt as though
she were in touch with a “huge ball of
motivating energy” at that time. She
didn’t break through her addictions
then, but she did start to yearn for a
new life.</p>

<p>One year later, when Nancy was
32, she had Uranus = AP (0° Libra).
The powerful freedom urges from
Uranus bloomed, and she was compelled
to file for divorce to leave a very
unhealthy marriage. She also started
and, with great intensity, pursued the
process for ending and healing her
addiction patterns. When she was 33
with Ascendant = AP (0° Libra), Nancy said that she was offered an incredible
business opportunity, but she felt intimidated
and not quite ready to trust herself
to follow through for success.</p>

<p>Now at age 53, she has Neptune =
AP (0° Capricorn), and the growth that
began when she was 31 has been integrated:
She has developed a strong
foundation of healthy habits and is
ready, even eager, to be visible and successful.
She started writing songs when
SA Neptune was in the bud phase (29°
Sagittarius), and she’s now in the process
of releasing her first CD as a singer/
songwriter. The creative energies of
Neptune have blossomed in a beautiful
and fulfilling manifestation.</p>

<p>Many of my female clients attest
that they were able to end a long-term
pattern related to a fear of confrontation
when Mars moved by solar arc to
the AP. Often I hear them say that this
cycle helped them to speak up and draw
appropriate boundaries so that they
didn’t feel victimized anymore. The courageous
energy of Mars “came forward”
and was finally projected out into their
lives.</p>

<p>I have countless examples of clients
who felt a tremendous surge of personal
confidence when their Sun solar arced
to the AP. It’s easy to develop a keyword
system to help understand the natural
thrust of the energy. For instance,
if a woman is in her childbearing years
and is seeking to become pregnant,
Venus = AP is a common signature.
Uranus = AP often carries a powerful
desire to break free, to stir things up,
and sometimes even rebel! Neptune =
AP can produce a beautiful creative or
spiritual bloom.</p>

<p>One of my clients (“Cynthia”) has
a natal conjunction of Uranus, Pluto,
and the Moon in Virgo sitting right on
her Midheaven. (<b>See Chart 3</b>, inner
wheel) She had a very controlling
and critical mother who maintained
that being a “good, normal, and
classy” girl was the most important thing
in life. Cynthia was heavily programmed
to dress smartly but conservatively. She
was trained to always be nice and try to
be perfect in every way. This was her
childhood mantra.</p>

<figure><img alt="All charts use Placidus houses and the Mean Node." style="float:left; width:50%; margin:0px 10px 0px 0px; box-sizing:content-box;" src="../../../../../img/articles/chartCynthia.jpg" />
<figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Cynthia admitted to me that she
had always wanted to have greater
flair in how she dressed. She had yearned her whole life to break free of
her mother’s restrictions and to dress
— to express herself — the way she
wanted. There was an inner desire to
be wild and free, for once! She needed
to accept her Uranus–Pluto conjunction
and powerfully radiate her uniqueness.</p>

<p>When Cynthia first came in for a
consultation in 2005, I noticed that her
Ascendant would move by solar arc
to the AP in four years (Chart 3, outer
wheel). I could see that, in 2008 (one
year before her Ascendant = AP), she
would have transiting Saturn crossing
her Virgo planets, with transiting Uranus
in opposition. I knew that her identity
could go through a growth period and
that the strong Uranus–Pluto statement
in her horoscope would be triggered. I
suspected that the transits would start
the process, but the Ascendant = AP
would trigger the outer change in her
image and help her to express her
individuality.</p>

<p>Sure enough, she came in for
another session in late 2009, wearing
quirky cowboy boots and a mini dress
with a big floppy sun hat! She was smiling
and genuinely happy that she finally
had the courage to project her originality.
Her Ascendant was shining and
enjoying a beautiful bloom.</p>

<p>And here is one more rather classic
but painful example of how the AP solar
arc triggers visibility when your life is not
on track. Actor Charlie Sheen is known
for his high-profile problems with addiction.
He had Neptune = AP exactly (0°
Capricorn) in early 2009. In late 2009,
Sheen was arrested for assaulting his
wife and was charged with felony menacing,
as well as third-degree assault.
His troubles were highly publicized, and
his unhealthy behavior was on display
for all to see.</p>

<p>Over the next two years, with
Neptune still in orb of the Aries Point,
Sheen’s drug use and bizarre tirades
became much more prominent and, in
January 2011, led to his dismissal from
his hit TV show, Two and a Half Men.</p>

<p>Sheen’s negative behavior and emotional
meltdowns were extensively covered
by the media and sensationalized
for many months. However, it’s significant
to note that, while he manifested
the behavioral confusion and ego wipeout
often associated with the shadow
side of Neptune, there appears to be a
positive result from the exposure. The
highly visible, acutely public crisis has
apparently helped Sheen to begin new
patterns and get his life, including his
acting career, back on track.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Astrological Rhythms that
Signal Growth</b></p>

<p>Solar arcs to the AP present a special
time for enhanced exposure and
projection of our inner potential and talents.
Our circumstances and life path
will suggest how this may manifest.
Remember, this is not always an indicator
of fame or notoriety; it may just as
well be a signal of quiet but important
personal realization or emotional breakthrough.
The result of these converging
influences is nevertheless a distinct and
determinative bloom.</p>

<p>We can plan for the growth that’s
scheduled to occur in our life by simply
looking for the Aries Point solar arc
and understanding that conditions will
be right for some part of our nature to
emerge and become more visible.</p>

<p>Informing our clients of the timing
for solar arcs to the AP can be most
helpful — this shines a light of awareness
that provides specific nourishment
for a spectacular bloom. Clients are
grateful for this guidance, because
they can then choose to cooperate
with the cycle in the way that’s right
and “natural” for them.</p>

<p>When we flow with the timing of
the cycles in our horoscope, we enjoy
more success on all levels. We give permission
for significant personal development.
We acknowledge and honor the astrological “rosebuds” in our lives
— the exquisite promise of expansive
growth that is within us all.</p>

                            <p>There is an extremely sensitive and powerful zone in the zodiac located at the 0 degrees point of the four cardinal signs - a special area that relates to high public visibility. Actually, we could say that the Aries Point has an orb that starts at 29 degrees mutable and ends at 1 degree cardinal. Planets or angles at the Aries Point in our natal chart have the potential for high visibility in life. Sometimes this can suggest fame or notoriety. The AP indicates the presence of energy insistence that pushes a planet or angle into public view.</p>
