<p class="text-muted">Part of your 60-minute private consultation will be devoted to understanding your present situation, emotional patterns and relevant behaviors. We will discuss key astrological energies impacting your life now and how you can best use these planetary aspects to create a more supportive personal and professional environment for enhanced success. </p>
<p class="text-muted">I will also project your planetary cycles and horoscope activity forward for the next 2-3 years. Youâ€™ll get an easy-to-understand, helpful, and uplifting picture of your life potential, as well as a look ahead to the major events, changes and opportunities as suggested by your horoscope. </p>
<p class="text-muted">This consultation is a two-way discussion that's not only free of technical jargon but also rich with accessible insight and useful advice you can actually put into practice. Our interaction is very much a dialogue - you are invited to ask questions or seek clarifications at any time. </p>
